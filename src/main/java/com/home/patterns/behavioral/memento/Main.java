    //  Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels, operated by a hydraulic system.
    // The brakes may be disc type or drum type.
    //
    //  The front brakes play a greater part in stopping the car than the rear ones,
    // because braking throws the car weight forward on to the front wheels.
    //
    //  Many cars therefore have disc brakes, which are generally more efficient, at
    // the front, and drum brakes at the rear.
    //
    //  Imagine a scenario in which we need to replace the drum brakes at the rear
    // by ourselves? How do we ensure that the new drum brake has all the necessary
    // pieces in their proper places? One solution might be to use the Memento.
    //
    //  The drums are removed from both sides, exposing both the right and left brakes.
    // Only one side is disassembled and the other serves as a Memento of how the
    // brake parts fit together. The other side is disassembled only after the job
    // has been completed on one side. When the second side is disassembled, the first
    // side acts as the Memento.
    //
    //  Thus we have an example of the Memento design pattern. Memento design pattern
    // helps to restore an objectâ€™s state to it previous state.
